      excerpt: 'I have a bad habbit of switching the backends of my website.  Hey this is IT and development so trying new things is just part of the process.  When I developed the Ghost version of this website, I wrote a script to publish the site on GitHub pages.  I thought I was done.  I would use ghost from this point on... unless Ghost did something earth shatteringly bad.  Well Ghost did. **Markdown** formatting. Left aligned with `type="left"`'
